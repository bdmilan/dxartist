When I say 'true Indian history', it is not after Moghuls invaded us or after British invaded us. True hostory starting from Indus Valley Civilization.

Indus Valley Civilization is the oldest civilization in the world. Which means that we were civilized(organized, sophisticated) before anyone on the whole world. It was 8000 years old. (And some people still think that the world is just 6000 years old. They should disagree the existence of Dinosaurs)

## Religion
This civilization followed one religion where they believed in Linga(phallus) and Yoni(vulva). The swastika seals found in the site is an evidence that this religion is the precursor of Hinduism. It also proved that Hinduism is the oldest religion which later spread from todays Afghanistan to South East Asian countries.

**Pashupathi (beleived to be the precursor of Shiva)**

## Science
They knew enough metullurgy to produce Iron, copper, bronze, lead and tin. They had sophosticated water reservoirs and sewage system. They were experts in carving sculptures, seals, pottery, jewellery, terracotta etc., [Sir John Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall_(archaeologist)) says that "Greek artistry could possibly have been anticipated by the sculptors of a far-off age on the banks of the Indus".

Indus Valley people are the first ones to use wheels and boats!
